I started this project with a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and a cheap clone RTL-SDR dongle.
For the antenna, I initially used a simple VHF/UHF window antenna attached indoors.
Later, I switched to a V-shaped dipole for ADS-B reception.


This was the first antenna I tried.

At that time, I did not fully understand how antenna placement affects performance.
I assumed any antenna near a window would work well.


Here is how it was installed.
